## Project realized during the course of electronics 4 in the university of San Carlos from Guatemala

The project aims to develop a circuit that can provide power to a device in the event of a power outage in a residential or commercial setting. To accomplish this, a battery is utilized to power an inverter circuit that converts a 60 Hz AC signal with a peak voltage of 12 volts to a 110-volt, 60 Hz AC signal that can power the device. This transformer-based circuit allows for uninterrupted power supply to the device.
